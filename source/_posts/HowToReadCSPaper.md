### Different Types of CS Research Paper

There are three basic types of CS research paper: **theoretical**, **engineering** and **empirical**.

- A theoretical paper describes a theory or algorithm or provides a mathematical proof for some hypothesis.
- An engineering paper describes an implementation of an algorithm, or part or all of a computer system or application. Engineering papers are now frequently required to include descriptions of system evaluation.
- An empirical paper describes an experiment designed to test some hypothesis.

### Taxonomy of Scientific Papers

- Conference Papers

  - Review : YES , peer-reviewed , the threshold depends on the conference

  - Goal : Publish a finished work with possible forthcoming research

  - Size : 8 - 20 Pages

- Journal Papers

  - Review : YES , peer-reviewed , more longer than Conference Papers

  - Goal : Publish a present completed work

  - Size : 15 Pages



### How call I tell whether a research paper is good before I read it?

Here are some indicators of a good research paper:

- 1) The problem the paper addresses is clearly stated, both in the abstract and early on in the paper itself. The technical importance and broader impacts of the paper are described. 

- 2) The paper includes a clear description of the experiment, system or theory the problem addresses. This is usually the second section of the paper. 

- 3) The paper describes and analyzes the results of the work described (either experimental or evaluation results).

- 4) The authors have some sound, non-trivial ideas for future work. This usually appears at the end of the paper. 

- 5) Related work is described and cited correctly. You can get an idea of this by looking at the list of references at the end of the paper. 

If you know that a researcher has been working in an area for a while, that is usually an indicator that the research is sound; however, do not underestimate the contributions of people new to a field or the impact of politics on research.



### Read with "three-pass" method

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plowing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass:

- The first pass gives you a **general idea** about the paper.
- The second pass lets you **grasp the paper’s content**, but not its details. 
- The third pass helps you **understand the paper in depth**.　



#### THE FIRST PASS

This pass should take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps:

1.  Carefully read the **title**, **abstract**, and **introduction** 
2.  Read the section and sub-section **headings**, but ignore everything else 
3.  Read the **conclusions**
4.  Glance over the **references**, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read



#### THE SECOND PASS

1. **Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper**. Pay special attention to graphs. Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent. 
2. **Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading** (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).

The second pass should take up to an hour.



#### THE THIRD PASS

This pass requires great attention to detail. **You should identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.** Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would present a particular idea. This comparison of the actual with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely add this to your repertoire of tools. During this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work.

This pass can take about four or five hours for beginners, and about an hour for an experienced reader.
